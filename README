GMail Auto-archiver

Archive emails in your gmail inbox older than a certain date.

Usage:
    1. Set up auto labels in gmail with the pattern 'autoarchive:\d+' where \d+
    is the age limit in days.
    2. Either hardcode your email/password in the script or enter them
    interactively when the script is run.
    3. Execute the script! Set it up to run daily for best results.
